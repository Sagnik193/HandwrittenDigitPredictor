# HandwrittenDigitPredictor
Building a pattern recognition model using SVM to predict correctly handwritten digits between 0 to 9. 

MNIST dataset has been used for this purpose. 
In the end of the model building exercise, a model with an accuracy level of 95.4% was achieved. 
Linear SVM, Radial Kernel SVM & a polynomial Kernel SVM were tried to develop the model.
